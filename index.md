<h2 id="general">General Information</h2>

Many researchers, institutes, governments and other funding bodies nowadays
subscribe to a vision on open science. The general premise is that scholarly
research can be more effective and transparent if everyone shares their data,
methods, codes, tools, analyses and results in a structured way, so that they
will be reusable and/or reproducible with minimal human effort.

A very concrete implementation of this idea are the FAIR data principles for
research data management. Many funders nowadays require that researchers
describe their adherence to these principles in a research data management plan.
Less concrete, but not less relevant, are ongoing initiatives to implement a
similar set of FAIR principles for research software, to set up collaborative
compute environments (shared infrastructure), and all kinds of tools to track
workflows and provenance information.

This workshop aims to provide an overview of, and facilitate discussion on,
relevant developments in this landscape of open science, specifically focusing
on the field of climate sciences. In three sessions, we will cover an
interpretation of the FAIR data principles in the context of climate sciences,
the basic principles for sharing software in a FAIR manner, and the use of
ESMValTool to streamline and homogeneize scientific workflows.


**Who**: This workshop is organized by the Netherlands eScience Center for
project partners in the EUCP (European Climate Prediction) Horizon 2020 project.

SYLLABUS

Show what topics will be covered.

1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
intend to teach.
4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
'tools/check' as well.
